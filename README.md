# SongTracker
Windows app that listens for songs near you and counts how many times it's been played.

I use it to graph the frequency of songs played by a radio station. The program uses a third party audio file song recognizer via API (acrcloud). Recording loops until cancelled, songs get stored in 'output.json'.
